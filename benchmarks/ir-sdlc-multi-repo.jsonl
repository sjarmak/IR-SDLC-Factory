Instead, a new adhoc variable was created.\r\n\r\nThis happened because `queryRunner.state.datasource` is undefined when all queries share the same datasource (non-mixed mode), causing the adhoc filter lookup to fail.\r\n\r\nIn v1, the panel ds was the ds from the queries when the queries were the same.

When batch results have failed items, we\r\nfirst retry only a single item using the SDK client's retry strategy\r\n(exponential-backoff). Retrying a single item should provide enough\r\ntime to back-off from throttling or temporary GCS failures. Once a\r\nsingle item successfully retries, we proceed with the next batch,\r\ncombining the remaining failures and new items.\r\n\r\nRoughly this:\r\n- create batch of 100 new items\r\n- submit batch\r\n- receive 100 results, with 10 retryable failures\r\n- retry 1 failure using non-batched delete using SDK retry strategy\r\n- (loop) create batch from 9 remaining failures and 91 new items\r\n\r\nAlso extend test fixture to randomly fail individual items in batch.\r\n\r\nfix https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/138364\n\nChanged files: docs/changelog/138951.yaml, modules/repository-gcs/src/internalClusterTest/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStoreRepositoryTests.java, modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GcsRepositoryStatsCollector.java, modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStore.java, modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/MeteredStorage.java, modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/StorageOperation.java, modules/repository-gcs/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStoreContainerTests.java, test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/main/java/fixture/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageHttpHandler.java, test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/main/java/fixture/gcs/MockGcsBlobStore.java, test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/test/java/fixture/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageHttpHandlerTests.java\n\nFind related code that provides context for reviewing this change.", "context": {"pr_url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/138951", "changed_files": ["docs/changelog/138951.yaml", "modules/repository-gcs/src/internalClusterTest/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStoreRepositoryTests.java", "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GcsRepositoryStatsCollector.java", "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStore.java", "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/MeteredStorage.java", "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/StorageOperation.java", "modules/repository-gcs/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStoreContainerTests.java", "test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/main/java/fixture/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageHttpHandler.java", "test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/main/java/fixture/gcs/MockGcsBlobStore.java", "test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/test/java/fixture/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageHttpHandlerTests.java"], "additions": 347, "deletions": 118}, "ground_truth": {"locations": [{"file_path": "modules/repository-gcs/src/internalClusterTest/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStoreRepositoryTests.java"}, {"file_path": "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GcsRepositoryStatsCollector.java"}, {"file_path": "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStore.java"}, {"file_path": "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/MeteredStorage.java"}, {"file_path": "modules/repository-gcs/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/StorageOperation.java"}, {"file_path": "modules/repository-gcs/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageBlobStoreContainerTests.java"}, {"file_path": "test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/main/java/fixture/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageHttpHandler.java"}, {"file_path": "test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/main/java/fixture/gcs/MockGcsBlobStore.java"}, {"file_path": "test/fixtures/gcs-fixture/src/test/java/fixture/gcs/GoogleCloudStorageHttpHandlerTests.java"}], "relevance_scores": null, "granularity": "file", "source": "automatic", "confidence": 0.85, "metadata": {"pr_number": 138951, "changed_files_count": 10}}, "difficulty": "expert", "tags": ["code_review"], "created_at": "2025-12-29T17:30:32.532720", "source_issue": null, "source_commit": "deeb06b498d8fc42bd82a9e0b3291cd69c7172ec", "repo_stats": {"full_name": "elastic/elasticsearch", "file_count": 0, "directory_count": 0, "lines_of_code": 209255471, "contributor_count": 2408, "commit_count": 0, "language_count": 19, "size_kb": 1524746, "stars": 75749, "forks": 25751, "complexity_score": 97.5749}, "harbor_metadata": {}}
